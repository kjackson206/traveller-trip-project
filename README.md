# Unit 13 Mini-Project: Travel Planner

In this mini-project, you will work with a group to build an API using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize, and you will deploy it to Heroku.

## User Stories

- As a traveller, I want to be able to create an account.

- As a traveller, I want to be able to create a new trip for myself using a location from a list.

- As a traveller, I want to be able to create and view location data.

- As a traveller, I want to be able to view all of the trips I'm taking, along with their locations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- It's done when the GET route `/api/travellers` returns all traveller data without associated trips in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the POST route `/api/travellers` creates traveller data and returns a successful response in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the GET route `/api/travellers/:id` returns a single traveller's data with their associated trips and a list of locations in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the DELETE route `/api/travellers/:id` removes a traveller and any trips associated with them and returns a successful response in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the GET route `/api/locations` returns all location data in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the POST route `/api/locations` creates location data and returns a successful response in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the GET route `/api/locations/:id` returns a single location's data, with its associated trips, in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the DELETE route `/api/locations/:id` removes a location and any trips associated with it and returns a successful response in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the POST route `/api/trips` creates trip data between associated travellers and locations.

- It's done when the DELETE route `/api/trips/:id` removes a trip and returns a successful response in Insomnia Core.

- It's done when the API is successfully deployed to Heroku with a MySQL database.

## Specifications

- Database models should have the following fields and associations:

  - `Traveller`

    - `id`: primary key

    - `name`
    - `email`

  - `Location`

    - `id`: primary key

    - `name`

  - `Trips`

    - `id`: primary key

    - `trip_budget`
    - `traveller_amount`
    - `traveller_id`: non-unique foreign key that references the `Traveller` model's `id` field (`Traveller.id`)

    - `location_id`: non-unique foreign key that references the `Location` model's `id` field (`Location.id`)

  - Travellers have many locations, and locations have many travellers through trips (many-to-many association).

  - Set the `unique` flag to `false` to avoid a SQL error when creating the many-to-many relationship, because travellers can take multiple trips.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

- [Sequelize documentation on many-to-many relationships](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#many-to-many-relationships)

- [The Full-Stack Blog guide to deploying with Heroku and MySQL](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/deploy-with-heroku-and-mysql)

Use the following sample data as the request body POST `/api/trips` route:

```json
{
  "trip_budget": 2000.5,
  "traveller_amount": 6,
  "traveller_id": 1,
  "location_id": 2
}
```

## 💡 Hints

- What model association option can we set to automatically delete associated data?

- How can we use the data in `Develop/seeds` to provide starter data for locations and travellers and not have to create it ourselves?

- If we're deploying this to Heroku, can we work on this from within the class repository, or should we make a new GitHub repo?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

- Add validations to all of the model data.

- Create a password hashing and login system for travellers.

- Set up a **super many-to-many relationship** between travellers, locations, and trips to provide more querying options. To learn more, see the [Sequelize documentation on advanced many-to-many relationships](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/advanced-many-to-many.html).
